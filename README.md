Sometimes due incompatible software, like Checkpoint Secure Client, the Windows IPv6 stack is broken. The virtual IPv6 interfaces (ISATAP, 6to4, Teredo and IP-HTTPS) stop working.These interfaces are needed by technologies like Direct Access to work.

Use this troubleshooting pack when you have errors like *Failed to open tunnel adapter* or *Interface creation failure*.
